## Hello!

Sometimes (it's mostly about the header above the image) the text flows differently than in the design, because I wanted to keep the grid even, and not force it to match the text. If the designer wishes otherwise, I will of course adapt the website exactly to the project :wink:

Any tips will be greatly appreciated!
