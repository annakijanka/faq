## Hello!

Sometimes (it's mostly about the header above the image) the text flows differently than in the design, because I wanted to keep the grid even, and not force it to match the text. If the designer wishes otherwise, I will of course adapt the website exactly to the project :wink:

I hope I interpreted correctly that the photo with a dark car should be full width - regardless of the screen resolution.

Same with the active question in the accordion - I made it bold, though the design indicated that the bold should be in a different question. Forgive me if I misinterpreted this.

Also in the mobile view, I decided to leave the bulleted boxes separated by space (similar to the desktop version) to avoid creating classes just for the purpose of merging them into a single list. If we still want to combine them - I will add this class without any problem.

Any tips will be greatly appreciated!
